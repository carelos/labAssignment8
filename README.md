# lab_assignment_8
A heapify and merge function was implemented.
Heapify creates a tree data structure from the array and swaps the nodes in the tree to create a min heap.
A min heap is needed because the assignment was asking for a sorted array and a sorted array is from least to greatest.
Merge allocates memory of two intefer arrays for two integer pointers.
The indexes are then compared to each other and then update the unsorted array.
